## Installation

### Prebuilt Images

Feature limited builds of the image are available on the [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/nfrastack/container-uptimekuma/pkgs/container/container-uptimekuma) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nfrastack/uptimekuma).

To unlock advanced features, one must provide a code to be able to change specific environment variables from defaults. Support the development to gain access to a code.

To get access to the image use your container orchestrator to pull from the following locations:

```
ghcr.io/nfrastack/container-uptimekuma:(image_tag)
docker.io/nfrastack/uptimekuma:(image_tag)
```

Image tag syntax is:

`<image>:<optional tag>`

Example:

`ghcr.io/nfrastack/container-uptimekuma:latest` or

`ghcr.io/nfrastack/container-uptimekuma:1.0` or

* `latest` will be the most recent commit
* An optional `tag` may exist that matches the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) - These are the safest
* If there are multiple distribution variations it may include a version - see the registry for availability

Have a look at the container registries and see what tags are available.

#### Multi-Architecture Support

Images are built for `amd64` by default, with optional support for `arm64` and other architectures.

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [compose.yml](examples/compose.yml) that can be modified for your use.

* Map persistent storage for access to configuration and data files for backup.
* Set various environment variables to understand the capabilities of this image.

### Persistent Storage

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory | Description     |
| --------- | --------------- |
| `/data`   | SQLite Database |
| `/logs`   | Logfiles        |

## Configuration
